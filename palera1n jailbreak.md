## Jailbreaking the iPhone

Decide whether would you want a rootful or rootless jailbreak.

For rootful jailbreak
Still in Terminal or go to Terminal (Finder > Applications > Utilities)
`cd palera1n`
`./palera1n  -c -f`

For rootless jailbreak
Still in Terminal or go to Terminal (Finder > Applications > Utilities)
`./palera1n`

## How to re-jailbreak

For rootful jailbreak
Still in Terminal or go to Terminal (Finder > Applications > Utilities)
`cd palera1n`
`./palera1n  -f`

For rootless jailbreak
Still in Terminal or go to Terminal (Finder > Applications > Utilities)
`cd palera1n`
`./palera1n`


In both rootful or rootless jailbreaks, you will experience a hang on the phone (A9 or below) and when the terminal is showing Booting PongOS
1. Keep the usb cable connected, hit Ctrl+C on the terminal and 
2. Rerun the same palera1n command with the same options.

Notes: For rootful jailbreak, it will take at least 15 minutes to build the fakefs. So let the phone run.
